### Key Points:

- The importance of testing both positive and negative scenarios in your code.
- Writing a test class using the `@isTest` annotation.
- Testing methods individually to ensure they function as expected.
- Ensuring code coverage meets or exceeds Salesforce's requirement of 75%.
- Adjusting the code based on test results to handle potential issues, such as negative input values.

### Covid-19 Apex Class:

This class manages recovery cases, offering functionalities like counting recovered patients in an area and updating the total recovered count in the country.

```
public class Covid19 {
    public static Integer recoveredInCountry = 0;
    public Integer recoveredInArea;

    public Covid19(Integer recoveredInArea) {
        this.recoveredInArea = recoveredInArea < 0 ? 0 : recoveredInArea;
        recoveredInCountry += this.recoveredInArea;
    }

    public void treatPatient() {
        recoveredInArea++;
        recoveredInCountry++;
    }

    public Integer getTreated() {
        return recoveredInArea;
    }
}
```

### Covid-19 Test Class:

This test class demonstrates how to write unit tests for the `Covid19` class, including positive and negative test scenarios.

```
apexCopy code@isTest
private class Covid19Test {
    @isTest
    static void treatPatientTest() {
        Covid19 jaipur = new Covid19(10);
        Integer treated = jaipur.getTreated();
        System.assertEquals(10, treated, 'Treated count does not match.');

        Covid19 hyderabad = new Covid19(112);
        treated = hyderabad.getTreated();
        System.assertEquals(112, treated, 'Treated count does not match.');

        // Testing the static field by checking the total recovered count
        Integer recoveredInCountry = Covid19.recoveredInCountry;
        System.assertEquals(122, recoveredInCountry, 'Recovered in country count does not match.');

        jaipur.treatPatient();
        treated = jaipur.getTreated();
        System.assert(treated == 11, 'Treated count does not match after treating a patient.');
        
        // Assuming the recoveredInCountry count updates correctly after another treatment
        recoveredInCountry = Covid19.recoveredInCountry;
        System.assertEquals(123, recoveredInCountry, 'Recovered in country count does not match after treatment.');
    }

    @isTest
    static void treatPatientTestNegative() {
        Covid19 jaipurNegative = new Covid19(-10);
        Integer treated = jaipurNegative.getTreated();
        System.assertEquals(0, treated, 'Treated count should be adjusted to 0 for negative input.');
    }
}
```

This lecture effectively demonstrates how to approach writing test classes in Salesforce, emphasizing the necessity of accounting for various scenarios to ensure robust and error-free code.
