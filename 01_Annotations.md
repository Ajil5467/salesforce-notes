**Overview of Annotations in Apex:**

- Annotations are utilized in Apex programming to modify how classes, methods, or variables are used.
- They can indicate changes in business logic, deprecate old methods, or specify method availability in certain Salesforce environments.

**Key Annotation Examples:**

1. **@Deprecated Annotation:**
   - Used to mark a method, class, or variable as deprecated.
   - Signals developers not to use the deprecated code and opt for the updated version.
2. **@AuraEnabled Annotation:**
   - Makes methods accessible in Lightning components and Aura frameworks.
   - Allows methods to be called from Aura components or Lightning web components.
   - Supports modifiers like `cacheable=true` to add properties to the annotation.

**Purpose of Annotations in Apex:**

- Annotations serve various purposes, from indicating method deprecation to enabling method access in specific Salesforce frameworks (e.g., Lightning).
- They may include modifiers to add specific properties or behaviors to the annotated elements.

**Examples of Other Apex Annotations:**

- **@Future Annotation:** Used for creating future methods to be executed later.
- **@InvocableMethod Annotation:** Allows methods to be called from Process Builders or Visual Flows.
- **@IsTest and @TestSetup Annotations:** Used specifically for testing purposes, marking test classes and setup methods.

**Practical Demonstration:**

- An example was provided with a method called "just another method" in a class named "Annotations Demo".
- Initially, this method could not be called from the Process Builder due to lack of appropriate annotation.
- By adding the `@InvocableMethod` annotation, the method became accessible from the Process Builder, showcasing the practical application of annotations.

**Conclusion:**

- Annotations are a critical feature of Apex programming, offering a way to manage code usability, compatibility, and accessibility within Salesforce environments.
