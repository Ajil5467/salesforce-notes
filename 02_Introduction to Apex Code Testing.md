**Introduction to Code Testing:**

- Testing is emphasized as a crucial aspect of the development process, equally important as coding itself.
- Effective testing can identify bugs or errors early, improving code quality and reducing user-reported issues.

**Salesforce Code Coverage Requirement:**

- Salesforce mandates a minimum of 75% code coverage for all Apex code before deployment to production.
- While 75% is the minimum, aiming for higher code coverage is recommended to ensure better code quality.

**Importance of Testing:**

- Testing is not just about making code error-free; it can have significant real-world implications. For example, a software bug led to a China Airlines plane crash in 1994, underscoring the critical nature of thorough testing.

**Types of Testing:**

- **Unit Testing:** Testing individual units or methods within the code by the developer.
- **System Integration Testing (SIT):** Conducted by software testers to check integration between systems.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Performed by business users to ensure the software meets requirements.

**Unit Testing in Salesforce:**

- Involves testing the functionality of individual methods with both valid and invalid inputs.
- Developers can manually execute tests via Salesforce's UI, CLI, or Developer Console.
- During deployment, a tool called Test-runner automatically executes tests to determine code coverage.

**Writing Effective Tests:**

- Tests should clearly define what is being tested, the method under test, and the types of values supplied (valid, invalid, bulk, single).
- It's crucial to verify the expected output for all types of inputs, considering both positive and negative behaviors.

**Key Points to Remember:**

- Unit tests should focus on both single and bulk actions, ensuring the code behaves correctly in all scenarios.
- Tests must also consider restricted user access, especially when dealing with sensitive data.

**Structure of an Apex Test Class:**

- Utilizes the `@isTest` annotation to indicate test classes and methods.
- Test methods must be static, void, and can only be public or global.
- A test method must reside within a test class and cannot be declared in a normal (non-test) class.
